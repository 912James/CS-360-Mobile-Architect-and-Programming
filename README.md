Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goal of this project is to develop an application that allows users to track their daily weight, set a goal weight, maintain their weight, and get notified when they reach their goal weight or successfully maintain their weight. The app will have a user-friendly interface that securely stores user data in a database, allows for easy login or sign-up, and displays daily weight entries in a clear and organized manner on the main screen. The app will aim to motivate users to achieve their weight goals by providing visual progress, reinforcing positive habits, and supporting weight maintenance. 
Types of users: 
a. Regular users: Individuals who want to track their daily weight, set a goal weight, maintain their weight, and monitor their progress over time. 
b. Fitness enthusiasts: Users who may want to track their weight in conjunction with their workout routine or diet plan. 
c. Weight maintainers: Users who have achieved their goal weight and want to track their weight to ensure they maintain it.
User goals: 
a. Regular users: Monitor daily weight, set a goal weight, visualize progress, maintain weight, and receive notifications when they reach their goal weight or successfully maintain their weight. 
b. Fitness enthusiasts: Track weight as part of a holistic fitness plan, monitor progress, adjust their routine as needed, and maintain weight. 
c. Weight maintainers: Monitor daily weight, set a weight maintenance range, receive notifications when their weight is outside the maintenance range, and track their success in maintaining their weight.
User needs:
a. Regular users: An intuitive and easy-to-use interface, secure login and sign-up process, ability to enter daily weight, goal weight, and weight maintenance range, visual representation of progress, and receive notifications. 
b. Fitness enthusiasts: All the features mentioned for regular users, plus integration with other fitness tracking tools and services, like Fitbit, Apple Watch, Android wear, a home gym, workout programs as in Apple fitness or Peloton, etc.
c. Weight maintainers: All the features mentioned for regular users, plus the ability to set a weight maintenance range and track their success in maintaining their weight.


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The screens that were necessary to support the user needs and create what i envisioned for the UI/UX were the login screen where the user is asked to enter their login credentials, forgot password or create a new account. Once the user enters the correct login information the next screen is the main home page which shows the weights entered by date. This screen also displays the target weight and allows the user to enter a new daily weight, edit an entry or delete an entry. The scresns attached to the home pageare the add scrren which allows the user to add a weight by specifying the weight and date, the delete a weight screen, update a the target weight and allow sms activity.
